| Service | Owns | Responsibilities |
|---|---|---|
| **api-gateway** | — | Only public entry point. Routes `/api/v1/*`, never exposes `/internal/*`, strips spoofable headers, per-IP rate limit, CORS allowlist, optional staff-network allowlist, liveness/readiness. |
| **auth-service** | `auth_schema` | Registration + email verification, Argon2id passwords, ES256 access tokens with Redis-backed revocation, rotating refresh tokens with reuse detection, TOTP MFA, forgot/reset/change password, lockouts, four-eyes staff administration. |
| **customer-service** | `customer_schema` | Customer profile (Redis cache-aside), KYC review by KYC officers (versioned), staff access log. |
| **account-service** | `account_schema` | KYC-gated account opening, Luhn-checked 12-digit numbers, freeze/close, daily limits; versioned sync of account controls to the ledger. |
| **transaction-service** | `ledger_schema` | Double-entry ledger: transfers, beneficiaries, branch cash (vault, teller drawers, suspense) with dual-control floats and blind counts, customer withdrawal codes, maker-checker, idempotency, limits, reconciliation. |
| **notification-service** | `notification_schema` | Kafka consumer; emails the real account holder over SMTP; retries, delayed-retry topic, DLQ. |
| **fraud-service** | `fraud_schema` | Amount, velocity and cash-structuring rules; alerts with four-eyes closure for fraud analysts. |

All money is integer **paise** (`"100000"` = ₹1,000.00) sent as strings.

## Roles

| Role | Can |
|---|---|
| `CUSTOMER` | Self sign-up. Own profile, accounts, beneficiaries, transfers, withdrawal codes. |
| `TELLER` | Accept the issued float, cash deposits and (code-authorised) withdrawals, blind closing count. |
| `KYC_OFFICER` | Decide KYC. |
| `FRAUD_ANALYST` | Triage fraud alerts (closing HIGH/CRITICAL alerts needs two analysts). |
| `SUPPORT` | Read-only staff views. |
| `BANK_ADMIN` | Issue floats, blind-count and sign off teller sessions, approve cash operations, account controls, staff administration (four-eyes). |

No single role can both create and approve money or identities: tellers can't approve, administrators can't
handle cash or decide KYC, and every staff identity change needs two administrators.

## Quick start (local development)

Prerequisites: Node ≥ 22, Docker with Compose v2.

```bash
npm install
node scripts/setup-dev-env.mjs            # creates .env + services/*/.env with random secrets
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d postgres redis redis-ratelimit kafka kafka-init mailpit
npm run build                              # common + Prisma clients + every service
npm run db:migrate                         # each service migrates its own schema with its schema-owner role
npm test                                   # unit tests

# Two bootstrap administrators (staff administration is four-eyes, so two are needed; the script refuses a
# third). Each run prints a ONE-TIME ENROLMENT_TOKEN for that administrator's MFA enrolment
# (set ENROLMENT_TOKEN_FILE=/secure/path to write it to a 0600 file instead of the terminal).
ADMIN_EMAIL=ops1@banksphere.local ADMIN_PASSWORD='A-long-Passw0rd' npm run create-admin -w @banksphere/auth-service
ADMIN_EMAIL=ops2@banksphere.local ADMIN_PASSWORD='An0ther-long-Pass' npm run create-admin -w @banksphere/auth-service

# Start every service (one terminal each, or a process manager)
cd services/auth-service && npm start      # ...and the other six
```

Emails (verification, password reset, staff activation, notifications) are captured by **Mailpit**:
http://localhost:8025. Dev Redis is published on **6380** (security store) and **6381** (rate limits) so it
doesn't clash with a locally installed Redis. After pulling changes that add new secrets, run
`node scripts/setup-dev-env.mjs --services` (keeps `.env`, appends new secrets, rewrites `services/*/.env`).

### Full stack in Docker

```bash
node scripts/setup-dev-env.mjs
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
docker compose run --rm -e ADMIN_EMAIL=ops1@banksphere.local -e ADMIN_PASSWORD='A-long-Passw0rd' \
  auth-service node dist/scripts/create-admin.js        # twice, with different administrators
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test                                     # unit tests (all services)
ADMIN_EMAIL=... ADMIN_PASSWORD=... ADMIN2_EMAIL=... ADMIN2_PASSWORD=... \
ADMIN_ENROLMENT_TOKEN=... ADMIN2_ENROLMENT_TOKEN=... node scripts/e2e.mjs   # enrolment tokens: first run only
```

The end-to-end suite (166 checks) drives real flows through the gateway, reads real emails from Mailpit,
waits for Kafka-driven notifications and fraud alerts, and actively attempts: privilege escalation, header
spoofing, forged JWTs, user enumeration, brute force, token replay after logout / reset / disable / refresh-token
theft, IDOR, theft from other accounts, money minting, self-approval of staff and cash, float and closing-count
manipulation, withdrawal-code guessing, idempotency double-spend, a 30-way concurrent overdraft race, payee
enumeration, payee-control, step-up and daily-limit bypass, stale KYC decisions, single-admin unfreeze/re-enable,
single-analyst alert closure and internal-API access. It fails if any request returns a 5xx.

## Production deployment

1. `cp .env.example .env` and replace **every** `CHANGE_ME`. Generate secrets with
   `node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"` (hex is URL-safe in URLs), and the
   ES256 key pair as described in `.env.example`.
2. Point `SMTP_*` / `MAIL_FROM` at your mail provider (SES, SendGrid, Postmark, ...). TLS is required by default.
3. Set `APP_BASE_URL` to your frontend. Email links go to `/verify-email`, `/reset-password`, `/staff/activate`
   and `/mfa/enrol`, always as `#token=...` (in the URL fragment, so it never reaches server logs or `Referer`).
4. Set `STAFF_EMAIL_DOMAIN` (staff must use your corporate domain), **`STAFF_ALLOWED_CIDRS`** (VPN/office
   ranges allowed to call staff-only APIs) and **`GATEWAY_TRUST_PROXY`** (proxies in front of the gateway that
   overwrite `X-Forwarded-For`; `0` if none). The services refuse to start in production without them.
5. `docker compose up -d --build`, then create two bootstrap administrators (see above) and hand each their
   enrolment token out of band. Every further staff member is requested by one administrator, approved by
   another, and activates their own account from the emailed link (choosing their own password, then MFA).
6. Terminate TLS in front of the gateway.

Production properties of the compose stack:
- Networks: `edge` (gateway only), `apps` and `backend` (internal, no internet), `egress` (only auth and
  notification, for SMTP). Only the gateway publishes a port.
- Containers run as non-root, read-only filesystem, `no-new-privileges`, all capabilities dropped, memory
  limits; base images pinned by digest.
- Postgres: per service an **owner** role (migrations only) and an **app** role (row DML only) on its own
  schema. App roles cannot alter tables, disable triggers, truncate, or update/delete append-only history
  (ledger entries, transactions, audit logs, KYC events, staff access log, fraud events, admin requests).
- Redis (security store): ACL users per service — only auth-service can write token state; other services
  have read-only access to it. AOF persistence and `noeviction`, so revocation state is never dropped.
  Rate-limit counters live in a separate, evictable Redis.
- Kafka: KRaft, SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512, one user per service with least-privilege ACLs (a service can only
  produce the events it owns); `<topic>.retry` and `<topic>.dlq` topics; auto-creation off.
- A one-shot `migrate` job applies migrations before services start; services wait for healthy dependencies.
  Migrations are written for live databases: large indexes are built `CONCURRENTLY`, CHECK constraints are
  added `NOT VALID` and validated separately, new columns are backfilled without table rewrites.
- Periodic full-table jobs (reconciliations) run on one replica at a time via a lease in `job_leases`.
- Liveness `/health/live` and readiness `/health` on every service; graceful shutdown on SIGTERM.

## API overview (through the gateway)

Authenticated endpoints need `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`. Money-moving endpoints need an
`Idempotency-Key` header (8–128 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, a UUID is ideal). Staff need an MFA session.

Errors are JSON: `{ "error": { "code", "message", "correlationId" } }`. `503 SERVICE_BUSY` /
`SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (with `Retry-After`) means nothing was committed and the request is safe to retry with
the same Idempotency-Key.

Swagger UI is served by each service at `/docs` outside production (`ENABLE_SWAGGER=true` to force it on).

## Security model

- **Identity only from verified JWTs**: ES256 with `kid` (algorithm pinned, issuer/audience/expiry checked);
  client headers like `x-user-id` are ignored and stripped by the gateway.
- **Revocable sessions**: access tokens carry a `jti`, a session id and the user's token version. Logout
  denylists the token and its session; refresh-token reuse (theft) kills the whole session, including access
  tokens already issued; password change/reset, MFA changes and disabling bump the version. Redis mirrors the
  state (the auth DB is the source of truth, re-synced periodically). Sessions have an absolute lifetime.
- **MFA**: TOTP (RFC 6238), single-use codes, attempt-limited challenges bound to the password-time token
  version, per-user lockout with an email alert. Mandatory for staff; staff enrolment needs a one-time enrolment
  token. Removing anyone's MFA is four-eyes.
- **Step-up**: transfers ≥ ₹1,00,000, large withdrawal codes and instantly-active payees need a TOTP code verified
  in the last 5 minutes on a factor enrolled at least 24 hours ago, so neither a stolen long-lived session nor a
  factor an attacker just enrolled with a phished password is enough.
- **Four-eyes administration**: staff creation, staff enable/disable and staff MFA reset are requests that a
  second administrator approves. Administrators never know staff passwords (self-activation by email).
- **Cash controls**: a cash general ledger (vault, teller drawers, suspense). A supervisor issues each float and
  the teller must count the same amount before it is booked vault → drawer; at close the teller and then the
  supervisor count blind (the teller never sees the expected figure), the counts must agree, the cash returns to
  the vault and any difference is posted to suspense and alerted. Every cash movement is therefore in the ledger
  and fake deposits surface as a shortage. Withdrawals need the customer's one-time code for the exact amount
  (emailed notice; brute force burns all codes); large or over-budget operations need a second person; a
  cumulative structuring rule flags split cash operations.
- **Dual control on account and user status**: an account frozen by a staff member (or held by one after its
  owner froze it), or a user disabled by an administrator, can only be reinstated by a different administrator.
  A daily limit set by an administrator is a ceiling the owner can lower but not raise past.
- **Payee controls**: transfers only to own accounts or registered beneficiaries; cooling-off unless added with a fresh step-up;
  first-day cap per new beneficiary; per-account and per-customer daily outflow limits.
- **Anti-enumeration**: register, login, forgot-password and resend-verification respond identically for
  known and unknown emails (Argon2 always runs; emails are sent after the response); the ledger checks the
  caller's own account before anything about the destination, and every unusable destination looks the same.
- **Brute force**: per-IP limits, per-account/network lockout with step-up to password reset when attacked
  from many networks, per-address email quotas.
- **One-time tokens** (verification, reset, activation, enrolment) are 256-bit random, stored as SHA-256,
  single-use (compare-and-set), short-lived, and invalidated by newer ones.
- **Ownership checks** everywhere; a non-owner gets `404`, same as a missing ID. Staff reads of customer data
  are logged in append-only tables.
- **Ledger invariants in the database**: ordered row locks, CHECK constraints (non-negative customer balances,
  positive amounts, balance cap), append-only entries/transactions/audit, per-user idempotency claimed inside the
  money-moving transaction, versioned account controls (each change reserves a unique version; a rejected or
  stale push never counts as success, and the ledger is never loosened automatically), and a periodic zero-sum
  reconciliation on one consistent snapshot (customer balances = cash accounts) that alerts on any mismatch.
- **Reliable events**: transactional outbox with leases, fencing and per-aggregate ordering (an unavailable
  broker only delays events; only messages the broker can never accept are parked, with an alert and a re-drive);
  consumers deduplicate, park transient failures on a delayed-retry topic served by a separate consumer group
  (a circuit breaker stops a dead dependency from stalling fresh events), and dead-letter poison messages.
- **Payee enumeration**: without a registered beneficiary every third-party account number gets the same answer.

## Known limitations

- Staff and customer identities are separate accounts. A staff member who is also a customer under another
  email is not automatically linked; linking requires a national identifier (PAN/Aadhaar) in KYC, after which
  staff operations on linked accounts should be blocked.
- A single KYC officer can verify a customer, and a single administrator can raise a daily limit above the
  customer cap (outflow stays bounded by the per-customer daily limit). Add maker-checker there if your risk
  policy requires it.
- Alerting is structured logs (`alert: ...` keys). Wire them to your log pipeline / pager; metrics endpoints are
  not built in.

- The bundled compose runs single-node Postgres, Redis and Kafka without TLS on internal networks. Use managed,
  replicated services with TLS for real production traffic.
- `npm audit` reports issues only in dev tooling (jest, ts-node-dev); production dependencies report 0.
